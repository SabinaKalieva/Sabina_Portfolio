# Project 1: Data processing and Visualization project
* The goal of the project is to follow the steps based on the article on the website fivethirtyeight.com about ratings.
* To determine whether we can come to the same conclusions that are given in the article.
* We will need panda and visualization skills to determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 were skewed towards higher movie ratings in order to sell more tickets.
