# [Project 1: Data processing and Visualization project](https://github.com/SabinaKalieva/Sabina_Portfolio/blob/main/Project%201%20Sabina.ipynb)
* The goal of the project is to follow the steps based on the article on the website fivethirtyeight.com about ratings.

* We will need panda and visualization skills to determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 were skewed towards higher movie ratings in order to sell more tickets.
